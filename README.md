## About The Project

#### This was a fun project creating a portfolio template full stack coding students can use to display eight projects, a downloadable copy of their resume, and links to their social platforms. The project portfolio features eight projects (with links to each respective project's deployed page). The code can easily be modified to create less or more depending on the student's need. The portfolio was to render responsively across a variety of devices with a clean and polished user interface.
